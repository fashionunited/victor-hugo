				Our SYMBOL</h1>
			<p>
				Coinciding with the company’s expansion and with a clear creative call, in 1985 Rosa Oriol was inspired by what would later become the brand’s symbol.</p>
			<p>
				“On one of my trips, I saw a teddy bear in a shop window that brought back fond memories of my childhood. Why not make one in gold? The bear marked the start of our expansion and it’s always present in our designs. It is very special to me and I am aware that we have gotten where we are thanks to the bear. The tenderness it transmits is universal.”</p>
			<p>
				For more than 25 years of history, the brand’s emblem, the bear, has warmed the hearts of all sorts of people with a youthful spirit and has become a lucky charm for many of them. With its rounded shapes and tender nature, it was designed to evoke the sweetest memories of childhood.</p>

					Our PRODUCTS</h1>
				<p>
					Jewelry is TOUS’s core business. Thanks to its success, in the late 20th century the company began to diversify its portfolio to offer a wide range of accessories, including handbags, fragrances, watches, glasses and accessories.</p>
				<p>
					The jewelry sets the pace of the other product lines, and under the watchful supervision of the company’s art director, the jewelry inspiration is always conveyed to all the other product categories.</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, each TOUS article reflects tenderness, fun and a youthful spirit as the brand values that convey the soul of the company.</p>

				<h3 class="fu-tous-title--small">
					ENERGY EFFICIENCY</h3>
				<p>
					In 2007, TOUS opened its new corporate headquarters in El Guix, Manresa (Barcelona) with the restoration of a former 19th century textile factory. The new TOUS building is part of a rehabilitation project in which environmental sustainability criteria were used.</p>
				<p>
					El Guix is a typical textile factory building in Catalonia which was built in 1870, making it the oldest textile factory in the region still standing and one of the few whose structure still remains intact. It has a rectangular area on the ground floor and two upper stories with large windows and stone walls.</p>
				<p>
					Its rehabilitation was used to apply bioclimatic criteria and building systems that help to foster energy savings and efficiency. To this end, the building has more than 1,000 m2 of photovoltaic panels to produce electricity, as well as solar panels to generate hot water. Plus, the installation of low-consumption fluorescent light bulbs throughout most of the building allows for high-performance light flows. Likewise, all the windows of the old building were left in place in order to use as much natural light as possible.</p>
				<p>
					In addition to rehabilitating the old factory, an adjacent glass building was also built, called El Cub (The Cube). It is one of the largest buildings in Spain which is sustained wholly on geothermal energy.</p>

				<h3 class="fu-tous-title--small">
					CULTURAL HERITAGE</h3>
				<p>
					TOUS participates in restoring iconic jewelry stores as a symbol of respect for the culture and tradition of the sector.</p>
				<p>
					In 2009, it opened its flagship store on Barcelona’s Passeig de Gràcia after restoring its interiors to match the original design of the rationalist architect, Josep Lluís Sert.</p>
				<p>
					Aware of the rich history of this site, its architectural uniqueness and its status as a protected building within the city’s architectural heritage, TOUS decided to recover the spirit in which it was designed with its interpretation of the original layout and furniture, thus contributing to reviving one of the most notable, studied examples of rationalist architecture in the region.</p>
				<p>
					Inside it has revived the essence of the original concept with the gray and blue colors that Sert planned for the entire interior. Plus, TOUS also commissioned reproductions of all the original furniture, including tables, chairs, display cases and the cash register counter, which were redesigned respecting the original concept and materials.</p>
				<p>
					In 2012, it reopened the Ourivesaria Aliança, an emblematic jewelry store in Lisbon, after restoring its interior, the works by Artur Alves Cardoso, its frescoes and furniture, as well as its famous wrought iron façade.</p>

					KIMBERLEY PROCESS</h3>
				<p>
					TOUS keeps careful watch over the sources of its raw materials.</p>
				<p>
					The Kimberley process is a certification system designed to prevent conflictive diamonds from entering the market. It was devised to ensure that purchases of diamonds do not finance conflicts or human rights abuses. More than 97% of the market is affiliated with the Kimberley process, and we at TOUS exclusively deal with suppliers which adhere to it.</p>
				<p>
					In addition to diamonds, TOUS exhaustively monitors the provenance of its other metals and materials used in all of its creative processes.</p>
